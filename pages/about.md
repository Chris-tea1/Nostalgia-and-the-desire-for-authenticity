The work in this digital repository is inspired by the culture surrounding photography and the sharing of photos as well as my own passion for the photographic medium, specifically analogue, and my personal connections to it. I have consistently through my life been surrounded by people who are passionate about photography. I have actively used their old film cameras for my own work, connecting my artistic practice to the generations before me. Nostalgia and the Desire for Authenticity is a culmination of work that embodies the connections we have to the photographic medium and how it links us to our past. There is an ardent desire to connect back to the analogue medium and the emotions it incites, the connections it makes with our past, and the past of photographic practices. As well as how it can inspire a feeling of nostalgia and longing for something we have not experienced. Whether through the direct medium or digital replica there is something inviting about the medium that we cannot seem to move past.
